### Task

L﻿ewis Carol wrote a poem called "Jabberwocky", and within this poem there were almost no words that were intelligible before it's time. We only now associate words such as "Bandersnatch" and "Vorpal" with his poem. What I was hoping to achieve with this project was to create a computationally generated poem that compiles three texts (Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Aesop’s Fables, and the Brothers’ Grimm Fairy Tales) jumbles them up, all the words in all three texts, and prints them out to create a nonsense poem. Some of the challenges in getting this project to be a success were centered around the formatting and jumbling of words from the three different texts.
