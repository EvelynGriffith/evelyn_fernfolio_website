### Task

In this project I was able to successfully have an Evodyne Evoarmminni stack 6 cups to form a cup tower. Some challenges that are associated with this project were the challenges that come with working with hardware that is inconsistent. I found that the robot would often shift from day to day, and I would have to make adjustments accordingly to the code. I also found that it was helpful to replace the motors if the robot was behaving inconsistently within a specific degree of freedom. Overall, the project was a success and I was able to have the robot stack several amusing cup towers!
