#### Educational Background

I﻿ am currently pursuing English (Creative Writing) with a double minor in Computer Science and Music Performance at Allegheny College in Meadville Pennsylvania.

#### W﻿hy I've Chosen to Pursue Creative Writing

I am hoping to pursue graduate school opportunities in English (Creative Writing). I am particularly interested in graduate schools that have full time Ph.d. programs centered around writing for children or adolescents. I am also very interested in pursuing jobs in Children's publishing.

When I'm not working toward my Literary pursuits, I am actively involved with the Allegheny Music Department where I participate in Women’s Ensemble, College Choir, Voice Lessons, and Opera Scenes. I am also a Senior Editor of the Allegheny Review as well as a devoted member and Leader of Allegheny Christian Outreach. I work currently as a Choral Librarian/Manager for the Allegheny Choirs as well as a Writing Consultant on campus.

###### My Current Pursuits - 6/4/2023

I have been awarded a Fulbright-MITACS Globalink Fellowship for the Summer of 2023 and as such I am currently working as a Computer Science Research Fellow at Trinity Western University in British Columbia, Canada.

Fun Fact: I recently performed a full Junior Recital where I sang 10 pieces in four different languages: French, German, Italian, and English.
